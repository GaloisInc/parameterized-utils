The parameterized-utils module contains a collection of typeclasses
and datatypes for working with parameterized types, that is types that
have a type argument.  One example would be a algebraic data type
for expressions, that use a type parameter to describe the type of the
expression.

This packaged provides collections classes for these parameterized types.
